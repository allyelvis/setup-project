Hereâ€™s a Bash script that automates the installation of dependencies, cloning a repository, setting up the environment, and generating a main.sh file. This script is generic and can be customized to your specific requirements.

Script: setup_project.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Setup Script to Install Dependencies, Clone Repo, and Generate main.sh

# Function to check and install required dependencies
install_dependencies() {
  echo "Installing required dependencies..."
  
  # Update package list
  sudo apt update
  
  # Install git, curl, jq, and any other dependencies
  sudo apt install -y git curl jq
  
  # Check if Node.js is needed
  echo "Do you need Node.js for this project? (yes/no)"
  read -r install_node
  if [[ $install_node == "yes" ]]; then
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
  fi
  
  # Check if Python is needed
  echo "Do you need Python for this project? (yes/no)"
  read -r install_python
  if [[ $install_python == "yes" ]]; then
    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
  fi

  echo "Dependencies installed successfully!"
}

# Function to clone the repository
clone_repository() {
  echo "Enter the repository URL to clone:"
  read -r repo_url
  echo "Enter the directory where the repo should be cloned (default: current directory):"
  read -r clone_dir
  
  # Use current directory if no directory is specified
  if [[ -z $clone_dir ]]; then
    clone_dir="."
  fi

  # Clone the repository
  echo "Cloning repository..."
  git clone "$repo_url" "$clone_dir" || { echo "Failed to clone repository."; exit 1; }
  
  # Navigate to the repository directory
  repo_name=$(basename "$repo_url" .git)
  cd "$clone_dir/$repo_name" || exit
  echo "Repository cloned into $clone_dir/$repo_name"
}

# Function to generate main.sh
generate_main_script() {
  echo "Generating main.sh script..."
  
  # Create main.sh with executable permissions
  cat <<'EOF' > main.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Main Script for Project Execution

echo "Starting the project..."

# Add your project-specific commands below
# Example: Run a Python script
# python3 script.py

# Example: Start a Node.js application
# node app.js

echo "Project executed successfully!"
EOF

  chmod +x main.sh
  echo "main.sh script created successfully!"
}

# Main script execution
echo "Starting project setup..."

install_dependencies
clone_repository
generate_main_script

echo "Setup completed! You can now run ./main.sh to execute your project."

Instructions:

1. Save the Script: Save the above script as setup_project.sh.


2. Make It Executable:

chmod +x setup_project.sh


3. Run the Script:

./setup_project.sh


4. Steps Performed:

Installs dependencies like git, curl, jq, Node.js, or Python as needed.

Prompts for a repository URL and clones it to the specified directory.

Generates a main.sh script in the cloned repository, which can be used as the entry point for the project.



5. Customize main.sh:

Add project-specific commands to the main.sh script to start the application or run scripts.




This script ensures your environment is set up and ready to run the project with minimal manual intervention.
